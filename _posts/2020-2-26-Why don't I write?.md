title: Why don't I write?
---

I have great ideas. I love sharing them. I love communicating. I have a fully functioning blog to share my ideas. Why then am I so afraid of writing?

I am afraid that I have to become someone else for people to like my writing. Everywhere you see there are tips, tricks, style guides, gurus telling you what to do. How to write. How not to write. What to write about. What not to write about. 10 tips to drive content and whatnot.

I fell into the trap and read up on all these things. It's alienating me to the very thing it's supposed to help me with. It's not fun to write with a checklist beside you. It's too rigid and stale. I have read a lot of things about how I should write but I haven't actually written anything. I have been looking for the wrong thing. All I want to do is write as I see fit. To give myself permission to make mistakes while writing what I want. And that's what I am doing now. With this little piece of text, I am permitting myself to be shitty, make mistakes, and suck at writing. But do so while writing what I want. Enjoy it as I did with the picture description exercises at the start of the year. I wrote tiny stories describing pictures in about 10 minutes. They aren't good stories. But, they were fun to write. A couple of them even inspired me to turn them into books. And that's what I am gonna do, starting this second. No more worrying about writing stale nonfiction that doesn't excite me. No more worrying about niching my blog. I am gonna be me, write stories I like, and talk about stuff I find interesting. Welcome to the GrapeScribbler, world. This is me.
