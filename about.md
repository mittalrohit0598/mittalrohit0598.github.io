Yes! my name is Harsh. It’s not what it seems, it’s Hindi for joy. 

I love stories, games, sports, and procrastination as much as anyone. What satisfies me the most is learning all I can and challenging the status quo. I love to explore every topic that fascinates me and I love sharing what I discover. I am passionate about Health, Technology, Psychology, Education, and Self Improvement but nothing is out of scope if it catches my eye. 

Welcome to The Grape Scribbler. A blog for all my crazy ideas, opinions and knowledge. I am not gonna claim to have the secret to success or the solution to all your problems. But do promise to write new, interesting and original content.
