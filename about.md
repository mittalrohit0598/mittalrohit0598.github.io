Yes! my name is Harsh. It's not what it seems, it's Hindi for joy. People enjoy labelling me without knowing who I am. I would like to clear any mis-understandings from here on out. This is me.

I am a joyful person at heart but often misunderstood. I love stories, games, underdogs, and procrastination as much as the next guy. The difference is I love learning and challenging the status quo. I love to explore every topic that fascinates me and I love sharing what I learn. I enjoy coming up with my own ideas and observations. Health, Technology, Psychology, Education, and Self Improvement are few of the topics I am passionate about but nothing is out of scope if it's interesting enough.

Welcome to The Grape Scribbler. A blog for all my crazy ideas, opinions and knowledge. I am not gonna claim to have the secret to success or the solution to all your problems. I do promise to write new, interesting and orginal content to the best of my abilities.
